Hi, I’m Nisha Kumari, a Computer Science graduate passionate about building visually immersive, interactive, and meaningful digital experiences.
This repository is intentionally minimal.

My full portfolio is live on Vercel, where I showcase:
-> Advanced frontend animations
-> 3D visual experiences (Three.js / React Three Fiber)
-> Clean UI engineering with performance in mind
-> Real-world projects blending creativity & logic

🚀 Why This Repository Exists
This GitHub repository serves as a gateway, not the source.

✨ Reason:

Some parts of my portfolio (especially custom 3D galaxy animations) are intentionally kept private
The focus is on experience, execution, and design, not just code visibility
Live demonstration > static code dumps

👉 The best way to understand my work is to experience it live

🧠 What You’ll Find in the Live Portfolio

✔️ Immersive 3D galaxy background
✔️ Smooth micro-interactions & animations
✔️ Dark-mode-first modern UI
✔️ Project showcases with real engineering depth
✔️ Performance-optimized frontend architecture

🎓 Helping Corner (Coming / Live Feature)

My portfolio also reflects my interest in mentorship & student guidance.

Project guidance
Skill roadmap planning
Frontend & AI/ML learning paths
Portfolio building advice

Thanks for stopping by ✨
